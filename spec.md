# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the bank logo image from the debit card and restore the original content that was there before.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the bank logo image from the top-right corner of the DebitCard component
- Restore the original text or branding element that existed in that area prior to the logo being added

**User-visible outcome:** The debit card displays its original top-right content (e.g., bank name text) instead of the logo image, while the rest of the card remains unchanged.

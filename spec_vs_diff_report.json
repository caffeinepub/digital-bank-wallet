  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented. The backend sets defaultBalance to 211_239 and the useBalance hook sets DEFAULT_BALANCE to BigInt(211239). The constraint about not altering existing user balances is respected since the defaultBalance is only used as a fallback when no balance entry exists for a user. No hallucinated features were detected.",

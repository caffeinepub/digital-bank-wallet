  "summary": "The diff implements all six requirements comprehensively. New components (MobileTopBar, MobileBalanceCard, MobileQuickActions, MobileRecentTransactions, MobileBottomNav) cover REQ-1 through REQ-5, and the Dashboard page is rebuilt to satisfy REQ-6. All acceptance criteria appear to be met with no significant omissions or hallucinated features detected.",

    {
      "description": "A 'View All' link to /transactions route is added in the Recent Transactions section",
      "reason": "The build request does not mention a View All link in the Recent Transactions section; REQ-4 only asks for displaying up to 5 recent transactions with skeleton loaders and an empty state.",

      "reason": "REQ-3 states quick actions are below the balance card; REQ-6 says the content section below uses a white/light grey background. The diff places MobileQuickActions inside the blue gradient header div alongside MobileTopBar and MobileBalanceCard, not in the white rounded content section.",

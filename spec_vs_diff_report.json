  "summary": "The diff implements the vast majority of the BlueStone Bank dashboard requirements. All seven REQs have corresponding implementation evidence. Minor gaps exist around the loading skeleton count for REQ-4 and some REQ-6 login page details being partially visible due to truncation, but overall coverage is strong.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Loading skeleton is displayed while data is fetching — the skeleton shown in RecentTransactionsList renders only 4 skeleton rows, not 5 as implied by 'at least 5 recent transactions'",
      "reason": "The skeleton loop in RecentTransactionsList maps over [1,2,3,4] (4 items), while the requirement states at least 5 recent transactions should be shown, suggesting the loading state should also reflect 5 rows.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/RecentTransactionsList.tsx"

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Blur animation on the balance toggle — filter: blur(8px) applied via hidden-balance CSS class when balance is hidden",
      "reason": "The requirement AC specifies masking the balance as '••••••' on hide. The implementation adds an additional blur and opacity CSS transition that was not requested.",

      "description": "ProfileSetupModal prompts for email and password fields during first-time profile setup",
      "reason": "The build request and requirements do not mention a profile setup modal with email and password collection. This appears to be an extra feature beyond what was specified.",
